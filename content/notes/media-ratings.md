media which i rated.

<!--more-->

ill never get the time to do this.
but one day id like to rewatch a bunch of the below movies
and compare them with each other and rank them on percentile based on comparison
(partial order) like gwern did: https://gwern.net/resorter

but for now it's just the usual imdb scale where
6 means not very good, 5 is bad, 4 is awful, and 7+ is good (8 better than 7, etc).

a bit more precisely, for me:  
4 (and below) very bad: all the way throughout the movie it felt like it was bad
and not entertaining  
5 means bad: i felt like i lost my time watching that movie. most of the time
the movie felt like it was bad.  
6 means it's not good but at least i felt partially entertained throughout.  
7 is good but nothing especially new/insightful like good but nothing
stands out much from other good movies.  
8 means generally very good.  
9 means among the best movies i watched but it didnt feel perfect: i have some
significant but not major criticism.  
10 means among the best movies i watched and i dont have any criticism that's
not very minor.
