### Comments on album _Never Never Land_
i can see some of the very good sides of other bands' music in
the following songs on the album:  
(some of those predates, overlap, and postdates pink fairies,
but im just talking about the style here, not the influence)

- _steppenwolf_ in _say you love me_
- _pink floyd_ in _Heavenly Man_
- _santana_ in _War Girl_

and on top of that i really like:

- rock, proto-punk in _do it_
- rock n roll, and _steppenwolf_-like  in _Teenage Rebel_
and also the other songs are amazing. and i like that they have drum solos, and blues-y guitar solos.

### TODO
albums to re-listen to and compare with _best albums of all time_ list.

- _Steppenwolf_ by _Steppenwolf_
- _Brothers in Arms_ by _Dire Straits_
- _Hotel California_ by _Eagles_
