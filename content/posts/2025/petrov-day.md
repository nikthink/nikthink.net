The main thing I cherish in Petrov Day is a sense of community, trust,
and taking seriously the responsibility for the ultimate consequences of our actions.

History and society celebrate those who win wars: Franklin Roosevelt, Winston Churchill.
These were _great_ men, but the **greater men** stopped these wars from ever happening.
Those names remain unknown to most, yet their actions preserved everything we hold dear.

Let it be known that September 26 is Petrov Day, in honor of a great man who saved the world,
and of whom almost no one has heard the name.

Wherever you are, whatever you're doing, take a minute to not destroy the world.
