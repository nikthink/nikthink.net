## Accounts
here are places you can contact me, and a list of accounts on other websites/apps.

i prefer being contacted by [plaintext](https://useplaintext.email/) email,
and that people separate messages in email threads with matching subjects;
but if you are allergic to emails then send me a message on discord,
or failing that too, on the other places listed here.

also see a list of cryptographically verified identities i have here: https://keyoxide.org/3626FCC7BF47A408CC69F621300932229C5B35A9
