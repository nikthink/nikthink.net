## Accounts / contact
here are places you can contact me, and a list of accounts on other websites/apps.

i prefer being contacted by [plaintext](https://useplaintext.email/) email,
and that people separate messages in email threads with mathing subjects;
but if you are allergic to emails then send me a message on discord,
or failing that too, on the other places listed here.
