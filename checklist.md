# Blog post checklist

- write about
    - dont write about things not matching below categories
    - new ideas
        - readers learn something new about the world or me, 
          or i invent somehting
    - what i care a lot about
    - something that makes people reflect/think,
      or things i want answers/thoughts on
- would my peers find it interesting to discussing this?
- what's the goal of the post? make it obvious to readers
- find relevant stats or studies
- remove strawman. what would disagreeing people say?
- find specific clear examples, of things actually happening, to point to.
    - if i cant find then maybe my point is false?
      or maybe i might not have thought enough about it,
      or how to put it clearly into words.
- specify how i did estimates/calculatoins when i do.
    - mention any use of fermi estimates in fermi calculations
- remove "i dont know"/"i didnt check"/etc and replace with more research
  or how i tried to search for this and failed
- replace criticism with "let's try to do better" type language
- replace criticism of individuals/groups with criticism of ideas/plans/etc
- remove/rephrase too much hedging
    - try to be more concise.
      or have a good tradeoff between technically correct and concise
- remove/replace "i think"
    - obviously that's what i think if im writing it
- break long sentences
- check what sections/paragraph i can delete
    - remove obvious/known info/ideas from post
        - readers should learn something new rather than reading
          things they already know.
- check what i can move to footnote or out of main text
- clarify/replace use of "this"/"that"
- add epistemic status?
- brainstorm alternate titles
    - check that the title by itself, out of context, is unobjectionable
- add humor?
- link to other posts from me (and others)
- first paragraph is a summary of post
- last paragraph is something that lets the reader in a nice state
    - examples:
        - a question
            - to let them reflect or post/comment about it,
        - call to action
        - conclusion? or have that before last paragraph?
- check for use of the word "significant"/"significance"
  and insert "statistically" as appropriate.
    - to disambiguate between _effect sizes_ and _statistical-significance_.
- convert to metric units
- spellcheck
- acknowledged people who helped
- add tags to post
    - year
    - topic
    - maybe: is it new idea or new info to reader,
      vs something i care a lot about,
      vs a question/reflection to readers i want their feedback on.
    - importance tags like gwern (incl percentile in name?) ?
- check that quotes are displayed properly
- check links go to intended destination
