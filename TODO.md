## To process
- 2025-10-26: to change my mind log:

      for cryonics info. first responders might not look there. thank carrie.

    - maybe it's ok to do "revloution" and remove the people inpower by force,
      if it's not killing them or hurting them physically, iceland style. summer 2025. thank person who made me think about this.
- 2025-10-26: to blog interpersonal relationships:
  intentionality, commitment, introspection, narratives,
  priorities too late, not robust.
