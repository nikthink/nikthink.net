# TODO for nikthink.net

- manually copy `legal-statements.html` during build.
  to make sure it's the same url and no redirect.
  i also probably dont want to list the page, at least for now.
- make sure home page links to changelog feed. `<link rel="alternate" type="application/rss+xml" href="changelog.rss" title="nikthink.net changelog" />`

- add blogroll and web feed for posts
- have a til log (Today I Learned). so that i can remember and share what I learned with people. and to show I love learning.
- on website put list of promises and who i paid for what. so that people can establish credibility of me paying them.
